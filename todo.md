# Things To Do

There are lots of things to do. Some are recorded as Atom todo-show (ctrl-shift-T) tagged entries (mostly in comments). The `todo-show` tag list in `~/.atom/config.cson` is mirrored by the top-level items below, in roughly decreasing order of priority. Tags below with trailing `/` are place holders. 

Order within groups sometimes reflects decreasing priority. Items are only listed here if they do not have a more meaningful location in other files. 

Excluded from the `todo-show` scan are library, auto-generated, and archive files, and for the time being `**spec.js` files. (See the `ignoreTheseTodos` and `ignoreThesePaths` properties of the `todo-show` configuration.)

- TODO
  - android device testing
  - android ionic view
  - enable hints in settings
  - card load spinner center
  - try apple archive run
  - deck filter option +/- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) spaced repetition algorithm (Leitner)
    - Enable (toggle)
      - default disabled with all active cards start in 0 group
      - on disable, cards remain in groups and index to first card in last group
    - Reset: cancel/confirm dialog returns all cards to 0 group and disables
       - hidden if all cards in group 0
    - Group list header
      - header: Interval | Remaining | Cards
    - Group list elements
      - N days (interval up/down widgets) | N days (remaining) | N (cards) | +
      - intervals are prime numbers, default groups: 0, 1, 7, 15
      - if up/down interval change reaches adjoining group, then $ionicPopup dialog with Confirm/Cancel for merging with encountered group
      - + icon adds group, absent if interval is 0 or next prime
        - initial interval is prime halfway between current and next group, or third-past for last
    - Question response when enabled: success to next group, or same if last group; failure to 0 group
    - Session number mod interval = days remaining
    - Sessions progress from longest to shortest interval with 0 days remaining.
       - if randomize questions mode, do so for each group before beginning it
    - Session ends when group 0 is reached and empty.
       - then display congratulations in card tab, with message to disable spaced repetition 
    - Card tab when at session end: display â€œDisable
