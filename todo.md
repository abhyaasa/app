Things To Do
============

There are lots of things to do. Some are recorded as Atom todo-show (ctrl-shift-T) tagged entries (mostly in comments). See the `todo-show` attribute list in `.atom_config.cson` for the tag list, in roughly decreasing order of priority.

A partial list of additional todo items follows, grouped in approximately decreasing priority order reflected by todo-show group tags. Order within groups sometimes reflects decreasing priority.

- FIXME bugs with unknown location follow

- REVIEW items for periodic consideration
