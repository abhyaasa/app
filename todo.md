Things To Do
============

There are lots of things to do. Some are recorded as Atom todo-show (ctrl-shift-T) comments. The following tags are in use, in approximately decreasing order of priority: XX-X (used without the dash to indicate temporary fixtures to be removed), FIXME, TODO, HACK, REVIEW, ANDROID, PUBLISH, FUTURE.

A partial list of additional todo items follows, in approximately chronological and/or  decreasing priority order, with ? flagging questionable items.
