## SGS Datta Deepam Flash Card Application

*Abhyaasa* is a Sanskrit term for practice, repetition, and study. It may refer to spiritual disciplines such as meditation, and also academic studies, as may be assisted by use of flash cards. This "flashcard" app is designed to eventually support [SGS Datta Deepam](http://www.sgsdattadeepam.org) with an expanding set of flashcard *decks* (quetion databases), with the intention that it continue to be maintained as an open source platform for other flashcard apps. It is suitable for a wide range of study through user-created flashcard decks and derivative apps.

> SGS Datta Deepam is devoted to the study of Vedic Dharma: "SGS Datta Deepam is an online gurukulam envisioned by HisHoliness Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji which unravels the boundless wisdom and truth in our Scriptures and brings to light the glory of Sanatana Dharma."

Some of the app features:

- A wide range of question types, including multiple choice, multiple answer, true/false, short answer, matching, and transliteration. Question text may be plain unicode or html, including images.

- Question database entry in json or a compact custom format. The latter supports a number of options, including markdown text formatting, sequence questions (in which the answer is the next question), and tag ranges.

- User choice of Devanagari or several Roman alphabet transliteration schemes for display of Sanskrit text.

- User selection of flash card decks from a library.

- Skipping of cards or their removal from the deck.
