Welcome to the **abhyaasa** flashcard app. *Abhyaasa* is a Sanskrit term for practice, repetition, and study. It may refer to spiritual disciplines such as meditation, and also academic studies. This app simulates decks of physical flashcards, which have long been used for academic study.

Swipe left to see the next slide of this app introduction. The **Got it!** button of the last slider exits this introduction.

The bar at bottom has buttons for selecting four primary tabs for navigating this app. Most of the time you will be using the `Card` tab view flashcards. But first you'll use the `Library` button, at left of the tab bar, to select the flashcard deck you wish to use. You can see your progress using a deck, and modify how it is used, with the `Deck` tab. The `Settings` tab provides information and control that is not specific to the current deck.
