## SGS Datta Deepam Flash Card Application

[SGS Datta Deepam](http://www.sgsdattadeepam.org) is devoted to the study of Vedic Dharma: "SGS Datta Deepam is an online gurukulam envisioned by HisHoliness Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji which unravels the boundless wisdom and truth in our Scriptures and brings to light the glory of Sanatana Dharma."

*Abhyaasa* is a Sanskrit term for practice, repetition, and study. It may refer to spiritual disciplines such as meditation, as well as traditional academic studies, as may be assisted by use of flash cards. This "flashcard" app is designed to supports SGS Datta Deepam with an expanding set of flashcard *decks* (quetion databases). It is also suitable for a wide range of study through user-created flashcard decks and derivative apps.

A partial list of supported features:

- A wide range of question types, including multiple choice, multiple answer, true/false, short answer, and matching. Question text may be plain unicode or html, including images.

- Question database entry in json or a compact custom format. The latter supports a number of options, including markdown text formatting, sequence questions (in which the answer is the next question), and tag ranges.

- User choice of Devanagari or several Roman alphabet transliteration schemes for display of Sanscrit text.

- User selection of flash card decks from a library.

- Skipping of cards or their removal from the deck.
